# StabilizingGlove
Stabilizing glove made for HL2032 at KTH by Sofia Hansson, Aida Hosseini & Alice Andersson 

The idea is to use a brushless motor as a gyroscope, where the momentum will be able to stabilize the tremors of someone with Parkinson's disease or Essential tremors.


## The components and their functions: 
- DX2205 2600KV- 4S Brushless Motor as a Gyroscope
- Accelerometer MPU 9265 for Detecting tremors
- Arduino nano as the Central control unit
- ESC - Hobbywing SkyWalker 30A as the Speed controller
- DC Lab Power Supply or 2S LiPo Battery as the Power source
